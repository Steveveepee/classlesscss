# Classless.css

Classless.css is one small CSS file, which defines few but great styles for basic HTML5 tags plus a few classes for grid and spacing. Nothing more. Nothing less.

**Check the demo** at [classless.de](http://classless.de)



## Features

* **Small.** 300 lines of CSS3 for Grids, Navigation Bar, Cards and more.
* **Responsive.** We use media queries, rem units, and smart overflows for tables and code.
* **Bootstrap Compatible.** The few classes use the same names as Bootstrap.




## Getting Started

You can simply insert the following two lines into your HTML file.
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://emanuel.regnath.info/classlesscss/classless.css" />
```
